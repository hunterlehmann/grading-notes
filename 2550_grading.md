# MATH 2550 Grading #

## Checkpoint 2 ##

Overall description of **Success**: Student can correctly find the tangent line and substitute into the formula properly. Student can compute an antiderivative of a vector valued function and understands how to apply an IC to find the constant of integration, although arithmetic errors may occur.

Errors that result in a **Not Yet**
* Giving an equation for part 1 that is not a line
* Ignoring IC for part 2 e.g. submission 6 or plugging in a different $$t$$ value than 0

Common feedback points:
* Careful! Is e^0 = 0?
* What domain do we need to get a full line?

## Checkpoint 3 ##

Errors that result in a **Not Yet**
* Any error in a/b/c except length of unit vectors
* Errors in d except confusing tangent vector and tangent line

## Checkpoint 4 ##

Errors that result in a **Not Yet**
* Misclassifying the quadric surface
* Forgetting to consider either domain restriction
* Incorrectly solving the inequality from the square root, except incorrectly excluding zero or getting just $$x\leq 2$$
* Sketch that egregiously does not correspond to the domain or is not clear (e.g. no shaded areas or excluded circle is the same width or wider than the band of points)
  * Not quite getting the correct indicators of included or not in the sketch is OK if the correct domain is written in symbols or words elsewhere

# MATH 2550 Grading #

## Checkpoint 2 ##

Overall description of **Success**:


Errors that result in a **Not Yet**
* Giving an equation for part 1 that is not a line
* Ignoring IC for part 2 e.g. submission 6 or plugging in a different $$t$$ value than 0

Common feedback points:
* Careful! Is e^0 = 0?
* What domain do we need to get a full line?
